Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text
information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial
trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading
tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we
propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic
market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,
optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of
market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis
for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising
from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,
the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of
multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance
short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the
position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More
importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a
vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a
scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such
as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans,
writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a
scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle
specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end
scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we
describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by
presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different
scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical
informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine,
neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from
different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies
methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We
report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who
provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the
strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we
discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such
technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code
at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run
directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and
the full app will be deployed on the cloud.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured
experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for
complex systems problems.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled
trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware
objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance.
Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong
performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's
ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI
navigation tasks. Code is available at https://leon022.github.io/GUI-Rise.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external

to +6.69% across all datasets.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand
knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive
problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis
formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing
benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we
introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the
next generation of code-based research benchmark.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.

Abstract: We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating
model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of
visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our
dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness
against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack
benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)
method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular
models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on
attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious
correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes
(color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in
our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's
realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform
evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further
explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of
traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus
on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance
between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework
contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign
recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and
distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in
developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where
malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to
bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the
encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful
instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with
negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to
mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that
tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text,
such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our
technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the
average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is
motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules
such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a
large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with
several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT
threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very
short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be
immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.

Abstract: The Internet of Things has expanded rapidly, transforming communication and

security breaches. Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT,
enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion.
Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a
standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack
analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness.
In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for
multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack

Deep Learning (DL) classifiers on the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, we
applied structured role-play prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented

Abstract: Security applications are increasingly relying on large language models

patterns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness
in general LLM applications, but its potential for cybersecurity remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce a RAG-based framework designed to
contextualize cybersecurity data and enhance LLM accuracy in knowledge
retention and temporal reasoning. Using external datasets and the
Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, we evaluate baseline RAG, an optimized hybrid
retrieval approach, and conduct a comparative analysis across multiple
performance metrics. Our findings highlight the promise of hybrid retrieval in
strengthening the adaptability and reliability of LLMs for cybersecurity tasks.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs), protecting
intellectual property and detecting unauthorized tampering of models have
become pressing challenges. Recently, Perceptual hashing has emerged as an
effective approach for identifying pirated models. However, existing methods
either rely on neural networks for feature extraction, demanding substantial
training resources, or suffer from limited applicability and cannot be
universally applied to all convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To address
these limitations, we propose a lightweight CNN model hashing technique that
integrates higher-order statistics (HOS) features with a chaotic mapping
mechanism. Without requiring any auxiliary neural network training, our method
enables efficient piracy detection and precise tampering localization.
Specifically, we extract skewness, kurtosis, and structural features from the
parameters of each network layer to construct a model hash that is both robust
and discriminative. Additionally, we introduce chaotic mapping to amplify minor
changes in model parameters by exploiting the sensitivity of chaotic systems to
initial conditions, thereby facilitating accurate localization of tampered
regions. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and practical value of
the proposed method for model copyright protection and integrity verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software development, enabling
AI-powered applications known as LLM-based agents that promise to automate
tasks across diverse apps and workflows. Yet, the security implications of
deploying such agents in adversarial mobile environments remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of security
risks in mobile LLM agents. We design and evaluate a suite of adversarial case
studies, ranging from opportunistic manipulations such as pop-up advertisements
to advanced, end-to-end workflows involving malware installation and cross-app
data exfiltration. Our evaluation covers eight state-of-the-art mobile agents
across three architectures, with over 2,000 adversarial and paired benign
trials. The results reveal systemic vulnerabilities: low-barrier vectors such
as fraudulent ads succeed with over 80% reliability, while even workflows
requiring the circumvention of operating-system warnings, such as malware
installation, are consistently completed by advanced multi-app agents. By
mapping these attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK Mobile framework, we uncover novel
privilege-escalation and persistence pathways unique to LLM-driven automation.
Collectively, our findings provide the first end-to-end evidence that mobile
LLM agents are exploitable in realistic adversarial settings, where untrusted
third-party channels (e.g., ads, embedded webviews, cross-app notifications)
are an inherent part of the mobile ecosystem.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated,
multi-stage pipelines, risk patterns that arise from unvalidated trust between
processing stages become a practical concern. This paper presents a
mechanism-centered taxonomy of 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial LLMs.
The analysis shows that inputs are often interpreted non-neutrally and can
trigger implementation-shaped responses or unintended state changes even
without explicit commands. We argue that these behaviors constitute
architectural failure modes and that string-level filtering alone is
insufficient. To mitigate such cross-stage vulnerabilities, we recommend
zero-trust architectural principles, including provenance enforcement, context
sealing, and plan revalidation, and we introduce "Countermind" as a conceptual
blueprint for implementing these defenses.

Abstract: Recent improvement gains in large language models (LLMs) have lead to
everyday usage of AI-based Conversational Agents (CAs). At the same time, LLMs
are vulnerable to an array of threats, including jailbreaks and, for example,
causing remote code execution when fed specific inputs. As a result, users may
unintentionally introduce risks, for example, by uploading malicious files or
disclosing sensitive information. However, the extent to which such user
behaviors occur and thus potentially facilitate exploits remains largely
unclear. To shed light on this issue, we surveyed a representative sample of
3,270 UK adults in 2024 using Prolific. A third of these use CA services such
as ChatGPT or Gemini at least once a week. Of these ``regular users'', up to a
third exhibited behaviors that may enable attacks, and a fourth have tried
jailbreaking (often out of understandable reasons such as curiosity, fun or
information seeking). Half state that they sanitize data and most participants
report not sharing sensitive data. However, few share very sensitive data such
as passwords. The majority are unaware that their data can be used to train
models and that they can opt-out. Our findings suggest that current academic
threat models manifest in the wild, and mitigations or guidelines for the
secure usage of CAs should be developed. In areas critical to security and
privacy, CAs must be equipped with effective AI guardrails to prevent, for
example, revealing sensitive information to curious employees. Vendors need to
increase efforts to prevent the entry of sensitive data, and to create
transparency with regard to data usage policies and settings.

Abstract: Phishing constitutes more than 90\% of successful cyberattacks globally,
remaining one of the most persistent threats to organizational security.
Despite organizations tripling their cybersecurity budgets between 2015 and
2025, the human factor continues to pose a critical vulnerability. This study
presents a 12-month longitudinal investigation examining how continuous
cybersecurity training and emotional cues affect employee susceptibility to
phishing. The experiment involved 20 organizations and over 1,300 employees who
collectively received more than 13,000 simulated phishing emails engineered
with diverse emotional, contextual, and structural characteristics. Behavioral
responses were analyzed using non-parametric correlation and regression models
to assess the influence of psychological manipulation, message personalization,
and perceived email source. Results demonstrate that sustained phishing
simulations and targeted training programs lead to a significant reduction in
employee susceptibility, halving successful compromise rates within six months.
Additionally, employee turnover introduces measurable fluctuations in awareness
levels, underscoring the necessity of maintaining continuous training
initiatives. These findings provide one of the few long-term perspectives on
phishing awareness efficacy, highlighting the strategic importance of ongoing
behavioral interventions in strengthening organizational cyber resilience. In
order to support open science, we published our email templates, source code,

Abstract: With the rise of location-based service (LBS) applications that rely on
terrestrial and satellite infrastructures (e.g., GNSS and crowd-sourced Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases) for positioning, ensuring their
integrity and security is paramount. However, we demonstrate that these
applications are susceptible to low-cost attacks (less than $50), including
Wi-Fi spoofing combined with GNSS jamming, as well as more sophisticated
coordinated location spoofing. These attacks manipulate position data to
control or undermine LBS functionality, leading to user scams or service
manipulation. Therefore, we propose a countermeasure to detect and thwart such
attacks by utilizing readily available, redundant positioning information from
off-the-shelf platforms. Our method extends the receiver autonomous integrity
monitoring (RAIM) framework by incorporating opportunistic information,
including data from onboard sensors and terrestrial infrastructure signals,
and, naturally, GNSS. We theoretically show that the fusion of heterogeneous
signals improves resilience against sophisticated adversaries on multiple
fronts. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
in improving detection accuracy by 62% at most compared to baseline schemes and
restoring accurate positioning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Systems programmers have to consolidate the ever growing hardware mess
present on modern System-on-Chips (SoCs). Correctly programming a multitude of
components, providing functionality but also security, is a difficult problem:
semantics of individual units are described in English prose, descriptions are
often underspecified, and prone to inaccuracies. Rigorous statements about
platform security are often impossible.
  We introduce a domain-specific language to describe hardware semantics,
assumptions about software behavior, and desired security properties. We then
create machine-readable specifications for a diverse set of eight SoCs from
their reference manuals, and formally prove their (in-)security. In addition to
security proofs about memory confidentiality and integrity, we discover a
handful of documentation errors. Finally, our analysis also revealed a
vulnerability on a real-world server chip. Our tooling offers system
integrators a way of formally describing security properties for entire SoCs,
and means to prove them or find counterexamples to them.

Abstract: x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application
programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept
cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these
services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent
trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a
reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as
endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and
propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and
temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services
preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction
volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to
natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation
propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many
low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation
payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled
services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely
volume based or semantic methods.

Abstract: Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding
great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they
could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the
risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous
data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach
remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune
these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \eval, a
framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce
the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \eval assesses models'
virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling,
mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that
current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded
knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits
broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals
may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via
simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data
filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research
into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation
models.
