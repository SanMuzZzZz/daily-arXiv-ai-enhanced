It is widely\nassumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its\ntarget concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone\nis an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV\ncaptures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to\ncapture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended\nconcept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned\nprobes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close\nto that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a\nnovel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and\nprovide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization\ntechniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further\npropose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept\nalignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness.

To address this, we introduce Iterative\nRegret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure\nthat repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base\nmodel.
