Abstract: Mental disorders are highly prevalent worldwide, but the shortage of psychiatrists and the inherent subjectivity of interview-based diagnosis create substantial barriers to timely and consistent mental-health assessment. Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions. We release LingxiDiag-16K and the full evaluation framework to support reproducible research at https://github.com/Lingxi-mental-health/LingxiDiagBench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Since the early 2000s, control of multiagent systems has attracted significant research interest, with applications ranging from natural collective behaviors and social dynamics to engineered systems such as autonomous vehicles, sensor networks, and smart grids. Although research on multi-agent systems has diversified into numerous specialized directions, textbooks -- including those in English -- that provide a systematic treatment of the fundamental principles of multi-agent system control remain scarce. The material presented in this book has been developed and used in teaching since 2021, initially as a concise Vietnamese-language reference for the courses Networked Control Systems and Control of Multi-Agent Systems at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The book focuses on a selection of fundamental topics of broad and continuing interest in the field. The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.
  The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks. Each chapter concludes with notes on notable researchers in this field, further reading, and exercises.
  This book cannot be completed without the encouragement, support and suggestions from families, colleagues and friends. The authors appreciate feedback from readers to further improve the content of the book.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most machine learning approaches to scientific discovery frame hypotheses as end-to-end predictions, obscuring the incremental structure of scientific reasoning. We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult. These findings support game-based reasoning as a principled route to more controllable, interpretable, and transferable hypothesis refinement systems for scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cyber threats have become highly sophisticated, prompting a heightened concern for endpoint security, especially in critical infrastructure, to new heights. A security model, such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), is required to overcome this challenge. ZTA treats every access request as new and assumes no implicit trust. Critical infrastructure like power plants, healthcare systems, financial systems, water supply, and military assets are especially prone to becoming targets for hackers and phishing attacks. This proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating tailored ZTA into organizations that manage sensitive operations. The paper highlights how the ZTA framework can enhance compliance, enabling continuous protection, thereby reducing attack surfaces. This paper aims to address the gap that exists in applying ZTA to endpoint management within cloud environments for critical infrastructure.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While the CHERI instruction-set architecture extensions for capabilities enable strong spatial memory safety, CHERI lacks built-in temporal safety, particularly for heap allocations. Prior attempts to augment CHERI with temporal safety fall short in terms of scalability, memory overhead, and incomplete security guarantees due to periodical sweeps of the system's memory to individually revoke stale capabilities. We address these limitations by introducing colored capabilities that add a controlled form of indirection to CHERI's capability model. This enables provenance tracking of capabilities to their respective allocations via a hardware-managed provenance-validity table, allowing bulk retraction of dangling pointers without needing to quarantine freed memory. Colored capabilities significantly reduce the frequency of capability revocation sweeps while improving security. We realize colored capabilities in PICASSO, an extension of the CHERI-RISC-V architecture on a speculative out-of-order FPGA softcore (CHERI-Toooba). We also integrate colored-capability support into the CheriBSD OS and CHERI-enabled Clang/LLVM toolchain. Our evaluation shows effective mitigation of use-after-free and double-free bugs across all heap-based temporal memory-safety vulnerabilities in NIST Juliet test cases, with only a small performance overhead on SPEC CPU benchmarks (5% g.m.), less latency, and more consistent performance in long-running SQLite, PostgreSQL, and gRPC workloads compared to prior work.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning relies on randomness as a fundamental component in various steps such as data sampling, data augmentation, weight initialization, and optimization. Most machine learning frameworks use pseudorandom number generators as the source of randomness. However, variations in design choices and implementations across different frameworks, software dependencies, and hardware backends along with the lack of statistical validation can lead to previously unexplored attack vectors on machine learning systems. Such attacks on randomness sources can be extremely covert, and have a history of exploitation in real-world systems. In this work, we examine the role of randomness in the machine learning development pipeline from an adversarial point of view, and analyze the implementations of PRNGs in major machine learning frameworks. We present RNGGuard to help machine learning engineers secure their systems with low effort. RNGGuard statically analyzes a target library's source code and identifies instances of random functions and modules that use them. At runtime, RNGGuard enforces secure execution of random functions by replacing insecure function calls with RNGGuard's implementations that meet security specifications. Our evaluations show that RNGGuard presents a practical approach to close existing gaps in securing randomness sources in machine learning systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based web agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex online tasks by directly interacting with web sites and performing actions on users' behalf. While these agents offer powerful capabilities, their design exposes them to indirect prompt injection attacks embedded in untrusted web content, enabling adversaries to hijack agent behavior and violate user intent. Despite growing awareness of this threat, existing evaluations rely on fixed attack templates, manually selected injection surfaces, or narrowly scoped scenarios, limiting their ability to capture realistic, adaptive attacks encountered in practice. We present MUZZLE, an automated agentic framework for evaluating the security of web agents against indirect prompt injection attacks. MUZZLE utilizes the agent's trajectories to automatically identify high-salience injection surfaces, and adaptively generate context-aware malicious instructions that target violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Unlike prior approaches, MUZZLE adapts its attack strategy based on the agent's observed execution trajectory and iteratively refines attacks using feedback from failed executions. We evaluate MUZZLE across diverse web applications, user tasks, and agent configurations, demonstrating its ability to automatically and adaptively assess the security of web agents with minimal human intervention. Our results show that MUZZLE effectively discovers 37 new attacks on 4 web applications with 10 adversarial objectives that violate confidentiality, availability, or privacy properties. MUZZLE also identifies novel attack strategies, including 2 cross-application prompt injection attacks and an agent-tailored phishing scenario.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cloud-mediated IoT architectures fragment authentication across vendor silos and create latency and availability bottlenecks for cross-vendor device-to-device (D2D) interactions. We present Atlas, a framework that extends the Web public-key infrastructure to IoT by issuing X.509 certificates to devices via vendor-operated ACME clients and vendor-controlled DNS namespaces. Devices obtain globally verifiable identities without hardware changes and establish mutual TLS channels directly across administrative domains, decoupling runtime authentication from cloud reachability. We prototype Atlas on ESP32 and Raspberry Pi, integrate it with an MQTT-based IoT stack and an Atlas-aware cloud, and evaluate it in smart-home and smart-city workloads. Certificate provisioning completes in under 6s per device, mTLS adds only about 17ms of latency and modest CPU overhead, and Atlas-based applications sustain low, predictable latency compared to cloud-mediated baselines. Because many major vendors already rely on ACME-compatible CAs for their web services, Atlas is immediately deployable with minimal infrastructure changes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone of knowledge-intensive applications, including enterprise chatbots, healthcare assistants, and agentic memory management. However, recent studies show that knowledge-extraction attacks can recover sensitive knowledge-base content through maliciously crafted queries, raising serious concerns about intellectual property theft and privacy leakage. While prior work has explored individual attack and defense techniques, the research landscape remains fragmented, spanning heterogeneous retrieval embeddings, diverse generation models, and evaluations based on non-standardized metrics and inconsistent datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first systematic benchmark for knowledge-extraction attacks on RAG systems. Our benchmark covers a broad spectrum of attack and defense strategies, representative retrieval embedding models, and both open- and closed-source generators, all evaluated under a unified experimental framework with standardized protocols across multiple datasets. By consolidating the experimental landscape and enabling reproducible, comparable evaluation, this benchmark provides actionable insights and a practical foundation for developing privacy-preserving RAG systems in the face of emerging knowledge extraction threats. Our code is available here.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study privacy amplification for BandMF, i.e., DP-SGD with correlated noise across iterations via a banded correlation matrix. We propose $b$-min-sep subsampling, a new subsampling scheme that generalizes Poisson and balls-in-bins subsampling, extends prior practical batching strategies for BandMF, and enables stronger privacy amplification than cyclic Poisson while preserving the structural properties needed for analysis. We give a near-exact privacy analysis using Monte Carlo accounting, based on a dynamic program that leverages the Markovian structure in the subsampling procedure. We show that $b$-min-sep matches cyclic Poisson subsampling in the high noise regime and achieves strictly better guarantees in the mid-to-low noise regime, with experimental results that bolster our claims. We further show that unlike previous BandMF subsampling schemes, our $b$-min-sep subsampling naturally extends to the multi-attribution user-level privacy setting.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid expansion of GPU-accelerated computing has enabled major advances in large-scale artificial intelligence (AI), while heightening concerns about how accelerators are observed or governed once deployed. Governance is essential to ensure that large-scale compute infrastructure is not silently repurposed for training models, circumventing usage policies, or operating outside legal oversight. Because current GPUs expose limited trusted telemetry and can be modified or virtualized by adversaries, we explore whether compute-based measurements can provide actionable signals of utilization when host and device are untrusted. We introduce a measurement framework that leverages architectural characteristics of modern GPUs to generate timing- and memory-based observables that correlate with compute activity. Our design draws on four complementary primitives: (1) a probabilistic, workload-driven mechanism inspired by Proof-of-Work (PoW) to expose parallel effort, (2) sequential, latency-sensitive workloads derived via Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) to characterize scalar execution pressure, (3) General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based tensor-core measurements that reflect dense linear-algebra throughput, and (4) a VRAM-residency test that distinguishes on-device memory locality from off-chip access through bandwidth-dependent hashing. These primitives provide statistical and behavioral indicators of GPU engagement that remain observable even without trusted firmware, enclaves, or vendor-controlled counters. We evaluate their responses to contention, architectural alignment, memory pressure, and power overhead, showing that timing shifts and residency latencies reveal meaningful utilization patterns. Our results illustrate why compute-based telemetry can complement future accountability mechanisms by exposing architectural signals relevant to post-deployment GPU governance.

Abstract: Today's business organizations need access control systems that can handle complex, changing security requirements that go beyond what traditional methods can manage. Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (RBAC: 14.5%, ABAC: 58.5%, DAC: 27.5%) while providing clear, human readable explanations for each decision. Performance testing shows that the system can be practically deployed with reasonable response times and computing resources.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive success across multimodal tasks, but their reliance on visual inputs exposes them to significant adversarial threats. Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems evolve from passive assistants into autonomous agents capable of executing consequential actions, the security boundary shifts from model outputs to tool execution. Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability.

Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge due to the proliferation of unauthorized derivative models. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs.

Abstract: Binary Function Similarity (BFS), the problem of determining whether two binary functions originate from the same source code, has been extensively studied in recent research across security, software engineering, and machine learning communities. This interest arises from its central role in developing vulnerability detection systems, copyright infringement analysis, and malware phylogeny tools. Nearly all binary function similarity systems embed assembly functions into real-valued vectors, where similar functions map to points that lie close to each other in the metric space. These embeddings enable function search: a query function is embedded and compared against a database of candidate embeddings to retrieve the most similar matches.
  Despite their effectiveness, such systems rely on bi-encoder architectures that embed functions independently, limiting their ability to capture cross-function relationships and similarities. To address this limitation, we introduce ReSIM, a novel and enhanced function search system that complements embedding-based search with a neural re-ranker. Unlike traditional embedding models, our reranking module jointly processes query-candidate pairs to compute ranking scores based on their mutual representation, allowing for more accurate similarity assessment. By re-ranking the top results from embedding-based retrieval, ReSIM leverages fine-grained relation information that bi-encoders cannot capture.
  We evaluate ReSIM across seven embedding models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in search effectiveness, with average gains of 21.7% in terms of nDCG and 27.8% in terms of Recall.

Abstract: Automated traffic continued to surpass human-generated traffic on the web, and a rising proportion of this automation was explicitly malicious. Evasive bots could pretend to be real users, even solve Captchas and mimic human interaction patterns. This work explores a less intrusive, protocol-level method: using TLS fingerprinting with the JA4 technique to tell apart bots from real users. Two gradient-boosted machine learning classifiers (XGBoost and CatBoost) were trained and evaluated on a dataset of real TLS fingerprints (JA4DB) after feature extraction, which derived informative signals from JA4 fingerprints that describe TLS handshake parameters. The CatBoost model performed better, achieving an AUC of 0.998 and an F1 score of 0.9734. It was accurate 0.9863 of the time on the test set. The XGBoost model showed almost similar results. Feature significance analyses identified JA4 components, especially ja4\_b, cipher\_count, and ext\_count, as the most influential on model effectiveness. Future research will extend this method to new protocols, such as HTTP/3, and add additional device-fingerprinting features to test how well the system resists advanced bot evasion tactics.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) considers a scenario in which an adversary has almost complete information about the entries of a database. This worst-case assumption is likely to overestimate the privacy threat faced by an individual in practice. In contrast, Statistical Privacy (SP), as well as related notions such as noiseless privacy or limited background knowledge privacy, describe a setting in which the adversary knows the distribution of the database entries, but not their exact realizations. In this case, privacy analysis must account for the interaction between uncertainty induced by the entropy of the underlying distributions and privacy mechanisms that distort query answers, which can be highly non-trivial.
  This paper investigates this problem for multiple queries (composition). A privacy mechanism is proposed that is based on subsampling and randomly partitioning the database to bound the dependency among queries. This way for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, upper privacy bounds against limited adversaries are obtained without any further restriction on the database.
  These bounds show that in realistic application scenarios taking the entropy of distributions into account yields improvements of privacy and precision guarantees. We illustrate examples where for fixed privacy parameters and utility loss SP allows significantly more queries than DP.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, yet these defenses remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts. While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \textit{where} defenses fail or \textit{why}.
  To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.
  Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.
  Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\%, a 2.3$\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\%) and Gemini (59.5\%).
  These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems.

Abstract: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 devices provide efficient hardware-based cryptographic security through tamper-resistant key storage and computation, making them ideal building blocks for multi-party signature schemes in distributed systems. However, existing TPM-based multi-signature constructions suffer from a fundamental limitation, they require interactive protocols where all participants must coordinate during the commitment phase, before any signature can be computed. This interactive requirement creates several critical problems, such as synchronization bottlenecks, quadratic communication complexity, and aborted protocols as a result of participant failure. These limitations become particularly heightened for applications that require cross-device cryptographic operations. This paper presents PiTPM, an Aggregator Framework built upon Schnorr's digital signature. Our protocol eliminates the interactive requirement using a hybrid trust architecture. The proposed framework uses pre-shared randomness seeds stored securely in an Aggregator, enabling deterministic computation of global commitments without inter-participant communication. The resulting signatures of the proposed framework are of constant size regardless of signer count. Our experimental results show a possible paradigm shift in TPM-based cryptographic system design, demonstrating that hybrid trust architectures can achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining rigorous security guarantees. We provide a comprehensive formal security analysis proving EU-CMA security under the discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model.

Abstract: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are integral to modern DevSecOps pipelines, yet tools like CodeQL, Semgrep, and SonarQube remain fundamentally constrained: they require expert-crafted queries, generate excessive false positives, and detect only predefined vulnerability patterns. Recent work has explored augmenting SAST with Large Language Models (LLMs), but these approaches typically use LLMs to triage existing tool outputs rather than to reason about vulnerability semantics directly. We introduce QRS (Query, Review, Sanitize), a neuro-symbolic framework that inverts this paradigm. Rather than filtering results from static rules, QRS employs three autonomous agents that generate CodeQL queries from a structured schema definition and few-shot examples, then validate findings through semantic reasoning and automated exploit synthesis. This architecture enables QRS to discover vulnerability classes beyond predefined patterns while substantially reducing false positives. We evaluate QRS on full Python packages rather than isolated snippets. In 20 historical CVEs in popular PyPI libraries, QRS achieves 90.6% detection accuracy. Applied to the 100 most-downloaded PyPI packages, QRS identified 39 medium-to-high-severity vulnerabilities, 5 of which were assigned new CVEs, 5 received documentation updates, while the remaining 29 were independently discovered by concurrent researchers, validating both the severity and discoverability of these findings. QRS accomplishes this with low time overhead and manageable token costs, demonstrating that LLM-driven query synthesis and code review can complement manually curated rule sets and uncover vulnerability patterns that evade existing industry tools.

Abstract: Unlike Ethereum, which was conceived as a general-purpose smart-contract platform, Bitcoin was designed primarily as a transaction ledger for its native currency, which limits programmability for conditional applications. This constraint is particularly evident when considering oracles, mechanisms that enable Bitcoin contracts to depend on exogenous events. This paper investigates whether new oracle designs have emerged for Bitcoin Layer 1 since the 2015 transition to the Ethereum smart contracts era and whether subsequent Bitcoin improvement proposals have expanded oracles' implementability. Using Scopus and Web of Science searches, complemented by Google Scholar to capture protocol proposals, we observe that the indexed academic coverage remains limited, and many contributions circulate outside journal venues. Within the retrieved corpus, the main post-2015 shift is from multisig-style, which envisioned oracles as co-signers, toward attestation-based designs, mainly represented by Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs), which show stronger Bitcoin community compliance, tool support, and evidence of practical implementations in real-world scenarios such as betting and prediction-market mechanisms.

Abstract: The advent of quantum computation compels the cryptographic community to design digital signature schemes whose security extends beyond the classical hardness assumptions. In this work, we introduce Spinel, a post-quantum digital signature scheme that combines the proven security of SPHINCS+ (CCS 2019) with a new family of algebraic hash functions (Adv. Math. Commun. 2025) derived from the Tillich-Zemor paradigm (Eurocrypt 2008) with security rooted in the hardness of navigating expander graphs over SL_n(F_p), a problem believed to be hard even for quantum adversaries. We first provide empirical evidence of the security of this hash function, complementing the original theoretical analysis. We then show how the hash function can be integrated within the SPHINCS+ framework to give a secure signature scheme. We then model and analyze the security degradation of the proposed scheme, which informs the parameter selection we discuss next. Finally, we provide an implementation of the hash function and the proposed signature scheme Spinel as well as detailed empirical results for the performance of Spinel showing its feasibility in practice. Our approach lays the foundations for the design of algebraic hash-based signature schemes, expanding the toolkit of post-quantum cryptography.

Abstract: The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) framework provides a common standard for protecting sensitive unclassified information in defense contracting. While CMMC defines assessment objectives and control requirements, limited formal guidance exists regarding evidence sampling, the process by which assessors select, review, and validate artifacts to substantiate compliance. Analyzing data collected through an anonymous survey of CMMC-certified assessors and lead assessors, this exploratory study investigates whether inconsistencies in evidence sampling practices exist within the CMMC assessment ecosystem and evaluates the need for a risk-informed standardized sampling methodology. Across 17 usable survey responses, results indicate that evidence sampling practices are predominantly driven by assessor judgment, perceived risk, and environmental complexity rather than formalized standards, with formal statistical sampling models rarely referenced. Participants frequently reported inconsistencies across assessments and expressed broad support for the development of standardized guidance, while generally opposing rigid percentage-based requirements. The findings support the conclusion that the absence of a uniform evidence sampling framework introduces variability that may affect assessment reliability and confidence in certification outcomes. Recommendations are provided to inform future CMMC assessment methodology development and further empirical research.

Abstract: The design of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) hardware is a complex and hierarchical process with many challenges. A primary bottleneck is the conversion of PQC reference codes from C to high-level synthesis (HLS) specifications, which requires extensive manual refactoring [1]-[3]. Another bottleneck is the scalability of synthesis for complex PQC primitives, including number theoretic transform (NTT) accelerators and wide memory interfaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results for coding in general-purpose languages like Python, coding for hardware design is more challenging; feedback-driven and agentic integration are key principles of successful state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we propose LLM4PQC, an LLM-based agentic framework that refactors high-level PQC specifications and reference C codes into HLS-ready and synthesizable C code. Our framework generates and verifies the resulting RTL code. For correctness, we leverage a hierarchy of checks, covering fast C compilation and simulation as well as RTL simulation. Case studies on NIST PQC reference designs demonstrate a reduction in manual effort and accelerated design-space exploration compared to traditional flows. Overall, LLM4PQC provides a powerful and efficient pathway for synthesizing complex hardware accelerators.

Abstract: Current agentic AI architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the security and epistemological requirements of high-stakes scientific workflows. The problem is not inadequate alignment or insufficient guardrails, it is architectural: autoregressive language models process all tokens uniformly, making deterministic command--data separation unattainable through training alone. We argue that deterministic, architectural enforcement, not probabilistic learned behavior, is a necessary condition for trustworthy AI-assisted science. We introduce the Trinity Defense Architecture, which enforces security through three mechanisms: action governance via a finite action calculus with reference-monitor enforcement, information-flow control via mandatory access labels preventing cross-scope leakage, and privilege separation isolating perception from execution. We show that without unforgeable provenance and deterministic mediation, the ``Lethal Trifecta'' (untrusted inputs, privileged data access, external action capability) turns authorization security into an exploit-discovery problem: training-based defenses may reduce empirical attack rates but cannot provide deterministic guarantees. The ML community must recognize that alignment is insufficient for authorization security, and that architectural mediation is required before agentic AI can be safely deployed in consequential scientific domains.

Abstract: Detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in user queries is critical for ensuring privacy in question-answering systems. Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization.

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks have broadened the ability to tackle oncology decision support tasks that require reasoning over dynamic, heterogeneous patient data. We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.

Abstract: What research can be pursued with small models trained to complete true programs? Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.

Abstract: In this work, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) framework designed for deployment on edge devices. To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents commonly condition actions on full action-observation histories, which introduce task-irrelevant information that easily leads to redundant actions and higher inference cost. We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction. Ablation studies show that both explicit progress prediction and selective retention are necessary for robust belief learning and performance gains.

Abstract: Scientific knowledge bases accelerate discovery by curating findings from primary literature into structured, queryable formats for both human researchers and emerging AI systems. Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains.

Abstract: Diversity can be broadly defined as the presence of meaningful variation across elements, which can be viewed from multiple perspectives, including statistical variation and geometric structural richness in the dataset. Existing diversity metrics, such as feature-space dispersion and metric-space magnitude, primarily capture distributional variation or entropy, while largely neglecting the geometric structure of datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities, we demonstrate that our proposed PLs-based diversity metric (PLDiv) is powerful, reliable, and interpretable, directly linking data diversity to its underlying geometry and offering a foundational tool for dataset construction, augmentation, and evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) can substantially extend the reasoning capacity of large language models (LLMs), yet most frameworks still aggregate agent outputs with majority voting. This heuristic discards the evidential structure of reasoning traces and is brittle under the confabulation consensus, where agents share correlated biases and converge on the same incorrect rationale. We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge.

Abstract: The rise of cyberbullying in social media platforms involving toxic comments has escalated the need for effective ways to monitor and moderate online interactions. Existing solutions of automated toxicity detection systems, are based on a machine or deep learning algorithms. However, statistics-based solutions are generally prone to adversarial attacks that contain logic based modifications such as negation in phrases and sentences. In that regard, we present a set of formal reasoning-based methodologies that wrap around existing machine learning toxicity detection systems. Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring. We evaluate different variations of our wrapper on multiple machine learning models against a negation adversarial dataset. Experimental results highlight the improvement of hybrid (formal reasoning and machine-learning) methods against various purely statistical solutions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being deployed within radiology at a rapid pace. AI has proven an excellent tool for reconstructing and enhancing images that appear sharper, smoother, and more detailed, can be acquired more quickly, and allowing clinicians to review them more rapidly. However, incorporation of AI also introduces new failure modes and can exacerbate the disconnect between perceived quality of an image and information content of that image. Understanding the limitations of AI-enabled image reconstruction and enhancement is critical for safe and effective use of the technology. Hence, the purpose of this communication is to bring awareness to limitations when AI is used to reconstruct or enhance a radiological image, with the goal of enabling users to reap benefits of the technology while minimizing risks.

Abstract: The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in geo-localization, yet they often struggle in real-world scenarios where visual cues are sparse, long-tailed, and highly ambiguous. Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating hallucinations while delivering precise and verifiable geo-localization.

Abstract: Long chains of thought (Long CoTs) are widely employed in multimodal reasoning models to tackle complex tasks by capturing detailed visual information. However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Shapley values have become a cornerstone of explainable AI, but they are computationally expensive to use, especially when features are dependent. Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.

Abstract: Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.

Abstract: Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a hybrid paradigm that enriches Answer Set Programming (ASP) with numerical constraint processing, something required in many real-world applications. The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate expert-level medical knowledge, aligning their open-ended outputs with fine-grained clinician preferences remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.

Abstract: Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) has emerged as a promising approach to developing general-purpose agents through automated curriculum generation. Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.

Abstract: Failures in large-scale cloud systems incur substantial financial losses, making automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) essential for operational stability. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.

Abstract: Clinical decision support requires not only correct answers but also clinically valid reasoning. We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance by generating long chains-of-thought, but often waste computation on redundant reasoning after the correct answer has already been reached. We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization. These results highlight early stopping as a simple yet powerful mechanism for improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents embedded in environments with physics-based interaction face many challenges including reasoning, planning, summarization, and question answering. This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.

Abstract: Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\% and 4.72\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Abstract: Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos $\href{https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage}{here}$.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model.
