Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) are susceptible to adversarial attacks. However, existing methods rely on the specific information mechanisms of target HGNNs, overlooking the common vulnerability caused by the significant differences in hyperedge pivotality along aggregation paths in most HGNNs, thereby limiting the transferability and effectiveness of attacks. In this paper, we present a novel framework, i.e., Transferable Hypergraph Attack via Injecting Nodes into Pivotal Hyperedges (TH-Attack), to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a hyperedge recognizer via pivotality assessment to obtain pivotal hyperedges within the aggregation paths of HGNNs. Furthermore, we introduce a feature inverter based on pivotal hyperedges, which generates malicious nodes by maximizing the semantic divergence between the generated features and the pivotal hyperedges features. Lastly, by injecting these malicious nodes into the pivotal hyperedges, TH-Attack improves the transferability and effectiveness of attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on six authentic datasets to validate the effectiveness of TH-Attack and the corresponding superiority to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.
