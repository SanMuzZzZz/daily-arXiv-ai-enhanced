This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack\nthat infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet\nsize and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption\nprotecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to\nenable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs\nfrom major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC)\nand high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target\nratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive\ntopics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations.\nThis industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under\nnetwork surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate\nthree mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet\ninjection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides\ncomplete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with\nproviders to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the\nneed for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle\nincreasingly sensitive information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Classical\ncryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES) have long provided the foundation for\nsecuring IoT communication. However, the emergence of quantum algorithms such\nas Shor's and Grover's threatens to render these techniques vulnerable,\nnecessitating the development of quantum-resilient alternatives. This chapter\nexamines the implications of quantum computing for IoT security and explores\nstrategies for building cryptographically robust systems in the post-quantum\nera. It presents an overview of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) families,\nincluding lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, and multivariate approaches,\nanalyzing their potential for deployment in resource-constrained IoT\nenvironments. In addition, quantum-based methods such as Quantum Key\nDistribution (QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are discussed\nfor their ability to enhance confidentiality and privacy through physics-based\nsecurity guarantees. The chapter also highlights issues of privacy management,\nregulatory compliance, and standardization, emphasizing the need for\ncollaborative efforts across academia, industry, and governance. Overall, it\nprovides a comprehensive perspective on security IoT ecosystems against quantum\nthreats and ensures resilience in the next generation of intelligent networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
