Abstract: In recent years, the research of multi-agent systems has taken a direction to
explore larger and more complex models to fulfill sophisticated tasks. We point
out two possible pitfalls that might be caused by increasing complexity;
susceptibilities to faults, and performance bottlenecks. To prevent the former
threat, we propose a transaction-based framework to design very complex
multi-agent systems (VCMAS). To address the second threat, we offer to
integrate transaction scheduling into the proposed framework. We implemented
both of these ideas to develop the OptiMA framework and show that it is able to
facilitate the execution of VCMAS with more than a hundred agents. We also
demonstrate the effect of transaction scheduling on such a system by showing
improvements up to more than 16\%. Furthermore, we also performed a theoretical
analysis on the transaction scheduling problem and provided practical tools
that can be used for future research on it.

Abstract: Optimizing large-language model (LLM) training on distributed domain-specific
accelerator systems presents significant challenges due to its complex
optimization space. Existing optimization methods, however, rely on
time-consuming manual tuning or resource-intensive black-box searches, which
struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving LLM domain, leading to slow
development and underutilized resources. To address this, we introduce ASAP, an
Agentic Solution to Auto-optimize Performance of Large-Scale LLM Training. It
is a multi-agent system, featuring Coordinator, Analyzer, and Proposal agents,
which integrates LLM reasoning with insights from performance profiling tools,
roofline analysis, and a knowledge base of best practices and successful past
optimizations from human experts. Our proposed design can automate the
diagnosis of performance bottlenecks and recommend optimized sharding
configurations with reasoning, thus effectively improving the efficiency of
distributed LLM training. Experiments have shown that the ASAP-generated
sharding configurations can contribute up to 28% training step time reduction
and 1.43 times throughput improvement. When combined with additional
optimization from human experts, throughput can be further increased to 2.58
times. The proposed ASAP promises to provide a scalable and explainable
methodology for AI-assisted performance engineering in large-scale LLM
training.

Abstract: Automatic question generation (AQG) for mathematics education remains an
elusive goal for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and educators. While pre-trained
transformer-based language models have significantly advanced natural language
generation, they often struggle to precisely control problem complexity and
cognitive demands. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative multi-agent
framework as a novel method of incorporating inference-time computation into
AQG. This approach leverages multiple agents that iteratively refine generated
question-answer pairs to better balance complexity and cognitive demand. We
evaluate the generated questions on five meta-evaluation criteria: relevance,
importance, clarity, difficulty matching, answerability, to assess the system's
ability to control the required complexity and quality of the questions.
Preliminary evaluations show that this collaborative multi-agent framework
elevates the quality of generated educational content by fostering a more
nuanced balance between cognitive challenge and clarity. These promising
outcomes suggest that integrating collaborative multi-agent workflows can yield
more controlled, pedagogically valuable content that can help advance automated
educational content generation and adaptive learning environments.

Abstract: Most intrusion detection systems still identify attacks only after
significant damage has occurred, detecting late-stage tactics rather than early
indicators of compromise. This paper introduces a temporal analysis framework
and taxonomy for time-aware network intrusion detection. Through a systematic
review of over 40 studies published between 2020 and 2025, we classify NIDS
methods according to their treatment of time, from static per-flow analysis to
multi-window sequential modeling. The proposed taxonomy reveals that inter-flow
sequential and temporal window-based methods provide the broadest temporal
coverage across MITRE ATT&CK tactics, enabling detection from Reconnaissance
through Impact stages. Our analysis further exposes systematic bias in widely
used datasets, which emphasize late-stage attacks and thus limit progress
toward early detection. This framework provides essential groundwork for
developing IDS capable of anticipating rather than merely reacting to cyber
threats, advancing the field toward truly proactive defense mechanisms.

Abstract: Child sexual abuse is among the most hideous crimes, yet, after the COVID-19
pandemic, there is a huge surge in the distribution of child sexual abuse
material (CSAM). Traditionally, the exchange of such material is performed on
the dark web, as it provides many privacy guarantees that facilitate illicit
trades. However, the introduction of end-to-end encryption platforms has
brought it to the deep web. In this work, we report our findings for a campaign
of spreading child sexual abuse material on the clear web. The campaign
utilized at least 1,026 web pages for at least 738,286 registered users. Our
analysis details the operation of such a campaign, showcasing how social
networks are abused and the role of bots, but also the bypasses that are used.
Going a step further and exploiting operational faults in the campaign, we gain
insight into the demand for such content, as well as the dynamics of the user
network that supports it.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) are
increasingly foundational to complex, distributed workflows. Yet, the security
of their underlying communication protocols remains critically under-examined.
This paper presents the first empirical, comparative security analysis of the
official CORAL implementation and a high-fidelity, SDK-based ACP
implementation, benchmarked against a literature-based evaluation of A2A. Using
a 14 point vulnerability taxonomy, we systematically assess their defenses
across authentication, authorization, integrity, confidentiality, and
availability. Our results reveal a pronounced security dichotomy: CORAL
exhibits a robust architectural design, particularly in its transport-layer
message validation and session isolation, but suffers from critical
implementation-level vulnerabilities, including authentication and
authorization failures at its SSE gateway. Conversely, ACP's architectural
flexibility, most notably its optional JWS enforcement, translates into
high-impact integrity and confidentiality flaws. We contextualize these
findings within current industry trends, highlighting that existing protocols
remain insufficiently secure. As a path forward, we recommend a hybrid approach
that combines CORAL's integrated architecture with ACP's mandatory per-message
integrity guarantees, laying the groundwork for resilient, next-generation
agent communications.

Abstract: Cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructures, such as water treatment
facilities, represent significant threats to public health, safety, and the
environment. This paper introduces a systematic approach for modeling and
assessing covert man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks that leverage system
identification techniques to inform the attack design. We focus on the
attacker's ability to deploy a covert controller, and we evaluate
countermeasures based on the Process-Aware Stealthy Attack Detection (PASAD)
anomaly detection method. Using a second-order linear time-invariant with time
delay model, representative of water treatment dynamics, we design and simulate
stealthy attacks. Our results highlight how factors such as system noise and
inaccuracies in the attacker's plant model influence the attack's stealthiness,
underscoring the need for more robust detection strategies in industrial
control environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Software fuzzing has become a cornerstone in automated vulnerability
discovery, yet existing mutation strategies often lack semantic awareness,
leading to redundant test cases and slow exploration of deep program states. In
this work, I present a hybrid fuzzing framework that integrates static and
dynamic analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided input mutation and
semantic feedback. Static analysis extracts control-flow and data-flow
information, which is transformed into structured prompts for the LLM to
generate syntactically valid and semantically diverse inputs. During execution,
I augment traditional coverage-based feedback with semantic feedback
signals-derived from program state changes, exception types, and output
semantics-allowing the fuzzer to prioritize inputs that trigger novel program
behaviors beyond mere code coverage. I implement our approach atop AFL++,
combining program instrumentation with embedding-based semantic similarity
metrics to guide seed selection. Evaluation on real-world open-source targets,
including libpng, tcpdump, and sqlite, demonstrates that our method achieves
faster time-to-first-bug, higher semantic diversity, and a competitive number
of unique bugs compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers. This work highlights the
potential of combining LLM reasoning with semantic-aware feedback to accelerate
and deepen vulnerability discovery.

Abstract: With the increasing frequency and sophistication of Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attacks, it has become critical to develop more efficient and
interpretable detection methods. Traditional detection systems often struggle
with scalability and transparency, hindering real-time response and
understanding of attack vectors. This paper presents an automated framework for
detecting and interpreting DDoS attacks using machine learning (ML). The
proposed method leverages the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) to
automate the selection and optimization of ML models and features, reducing the
need for manual experimentation. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is
incorporated to enhance model interpretability, providing detailed insights
into the contribution of individual features to the detection process. By
combining TPOT's automated pipeline selection with SHAP interpretability, this
approach improves the accuracy and transparency of DDoS detection. Experimental
results demonstrate that key features such as mean backward packet length and
minimum forward packet header length are critical in detecting DDoS attacks,
offering a scalable and explainable cybersecurity solution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly employ guardrails to enforce
ethical, legal, and application-specific constraints on their outputs. While
effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new
class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this
work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering
attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement
learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data
augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By
iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and
applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges
toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on
three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3,
and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while
requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical
feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks
for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities
in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust
defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The widespread deployment of high-resolution visual sensing systems, coupled
with the rise of foundation models, has amplified privacy risks in video-based
applications. Differentially private pixelization offers mathematically
guaranteed protection for visual data through grid-based noise addition, but
challenges remain in preserving task-relevant fidelity, achieving scalability,
and enabling efficient real-time deployment. To address this, we propose a
novel parallel, region-adaptive pixelization framework that combines the
theoretical rigor of differential privacy with practical efficiency. Our method
adaptively adjusts grid sizes and noise scales based on regional complexity,
leveraging GPU parallelism to achieve significant runtime acceleration compared
to the classical baseline. A lightweight storage scheme is introduced by
retaining only essential noisy statistics, significantly reducing space
overhead. Formal privacy analysis is provided under the Laplace mechanism and
parallel composition theorem. Extensive experiments on the PETS, Venice-2, and
PPM-100 datasets demonstrate favorable privacy-utility trade-offs and
significant runtime/storage reductions. A face re-identification attack
experiment on CelebA further confirms the method's effectiveness in preventing
identity inference. This validates its suitability for real-time
privacy-critical applications such as elderly care, smart home monitoring,
driver behavior analysis, and crowd behavior monitoring.

Abstract: The use of blockchains for data certification and traceability is now well
established in both the literature and practical applications. However, while
blockchain-based certification of individual data is clear and straightforward,
the use of blockchain to certify large amounts of data produced on a nearly
continuous basis still poses some challenges. In such a case, in fact, it is
first necessary to collect the data in an off-chain buffer, and then to
organize it, e.g., via Merkle trees, in order to keep the size and quantity of
certification data to be written to the blockchain small. In this paper, we
consider a typical system for blockchain-based traceability of a production
process, and propose and comparatively analyze some strategies for certifying
the data of such a process on blockchain, while maintaining the possibility of
verifying their certification in a decentralized way.

Abstract: Magecart skimming attacks have emerged as a significant threat to client-side
security and user trust in online payment systems. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving robust and explainable detection of Magecart attacks
through a comparative study of various Machine Learning (ML) models with a
real-world dataset. Tree-based, linear, and kernel-based models were applied,
further enhanced through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to
distinguish between benign and malicious scripts. Such models are supported by
a Behavior Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) which captures structural
behavior patterns in scripts, helping to analyze and classify client-side
script execution logs. To ensure robustness against adversarial evasion
attacks, the ML models were adversarially trained and evaluated using attacks
from the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox and the Adaptative Perturbation Pattern
Method. In addition, concise explanations of ML model decisions are provided,
supporting transparency and user trust. Experimental validation demonstrated
high detection performance and interpretable reasoning, demonstrating that
traditional ML models can be effective in real-world web security contexts.

Thus helping it to mitigate these evolving cyber threats. The paper studies the
architecture and functioning of LLMs, its integration into Encrypted prompts to
prevent prompt injection attacks. It also studies the integration of LLMs into
cybersecurity tools using a four layered architecture. At last, the paper has
tried to explain various ways of integration LLMs into traditional Intrusion
Detection System and enhancing its original abilities in various dimensions.
The key findings of this paper has been (i)Encrypted Prompt with LLM is an
effective way to mitigate prompt injection attacks, (ii) LLM enhanced cyber
security tools are more accurate, scalable and adaptable to new threats as
compared to traditional models, (iii) The decoupled model approach for LLM
integration into IDS is the best way as it is the most accurate way.

Abstract: The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage
capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the
process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of
safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption
at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to
various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing
has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of
hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's
Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts
within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even
with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we
have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and
ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a
thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies,
performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose.
In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible
weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on
the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security
infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation
for Confidential Computing.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language

its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical

the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,
and insights to guide future research.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and

unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
Scientist development.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
