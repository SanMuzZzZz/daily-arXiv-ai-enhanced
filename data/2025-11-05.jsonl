However, the role of human-like memory within\nthese frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents\ncoordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where\niterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the\nsuccess. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present\nEvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The\nframework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)\nand two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries\nby storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a\nquery, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by\naccumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory\nmodules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip\nplanning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance\nimprovements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success\nunderscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning."}

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

We identify the main\nchallenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove\nthe correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of\nlearned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.\nExperiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,\ne.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and\nshort-circuiting tasks."}

We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a\nlimited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple\nLLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes\nthe introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we\ndemonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently\ndismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we\npropose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness,\nrobustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications."}

Thus, smart contracts\nare subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits\nplay a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported\nvulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually\ncreating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight\naudit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically\ngenerates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability\ndescriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in\nan agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a\nReason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with\nthe Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and\nother security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world\nvulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow\nbaselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results\ndemonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort\nrequired for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution\nprovides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security\ncommunity."}
